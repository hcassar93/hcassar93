# Hi! I'm Hayden 👋

I'm building [Platfio](https://github.com/platfio) — a comprehensive platform designed to streamline how software agencies plan, sell, and deliver projects. I dog food Platfio at [Ashgrey Digital](https://github.com/Ashgrey-Digital), the software development agency I run that empowers businesses with cutting-edge web design, marketing automation, and complete digital solutions.

I share my thoughts in [my Blog](https://hayden-cassar.web.app). I'm passionate about developer productivity and workflow automation, tinkering with tools like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org), [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com), and [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) to transform my Mac into a finely-tuned productivity machine.
