# Hi! I'm Hayden 👋

We're building [Platfio](https://github.com/platfio) — a platform designed to streamline how software agencies plan, sell, and deliver projects. We dog food Platfio at [Ashgrey Digital](https://github.com/Ashgrey-Digital), a software agency that builds complete digital solutions for businesses across web design, marketing automation, and development.

I share my thoughts on software, tools, and sales in [my Blog](https://hayden-cassar.web.app). I'm passionate about productivity and workflow automation, tinkering with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org), [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com), and [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) to build a finely-tuned macOS environment.
