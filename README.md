# Hi! I'm Hayden 👋

I'm building [Platfio](https://github.com/platfio) — a comprehensive platform designed to streamline how software agencies plan, sell, and deliver projects. Born from years of agency experience, Platfio brings together project scoping, client management, proposal generation, and execution tracking into one cohesive system. It's my answer to the fragmented tools landscape that forces agencies to juggle CRMs, project management systems, and documentation platforms. With Platfio, teams can move seamlessly from initial client conversations through to project delivery, with intelligent workflows that actually understand how agency work gets done.

I'm passionate about developer productivity and workflow automation. I spend countless hours tinkering with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), crafting the perfect development environment with extensions and keybindings. [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org) lets me script macOS itself, automating window management and system behaviors. [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) is my go-to for screen recording and streaming, perfect for creating tutorials and documentation. And [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) rounds out my toolkit — these are the tools that transform my Mac into a finely-tuned productivity machine, where every keystroke and click can be optimized and automated to my exact preferences.
