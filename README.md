# Hi! I'm Hayden 👋

I'm building [Platfio](https://github.com/platfio) — a comprehensive platform designed to streamline how software agencies plan, sell, and deliver projects. Born from years of agency experience, Platfio brings together project scoping, client management, proposal generation, and execution tracking into one cohesive system. It's my answer to the fragmented tools landscape that forces agencies to juggle CRMs, project management systems, and documentation platforms. With Platfio, teams can move seamlessly from initial client conversations through to project delivery, with intelligent workflows that actually understand how agency work gets done.

I run [Ashgrey Digital](https://github.com/Ashgrey-Digital) — a software development agency that empowers businesses with cutting-edge web design, marketing automation, and complete digital solutions. At Ashgrey, we combine technical excellence with strategic insight to deliver transformative digital experiences for our clients. Our approach is rooted in modern development practices and a deep understanding of how businesses actually operate, ensuring every project we deliver isn't just beautifully built but meaningfully impactful. From startups needing their first digital presence to established companies modernizing their tech stack, we bring the same level of craftsmanship and care to every engagement.

I'm passionate about developer productivity and workflow automation. I spend countless hours tinkering with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), crafting the perfect development environment with extensions and keybindings. [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org) lets me script macOS itself, automating window management and system behaviors. [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) is my go-to for screen recording and streaming, perfect for creating tutorials and documentation. And [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) rounds out my toolkit — these are the tools that transform my Mac into a finely-tuned productivity machine, where every keystroke and click can be optimized and automated to my exact preferences.
